              <p>After passing MS from SMS medical college, I did srship at PGIMS, Rohtak...During my post graduation times i read standard books like novak, williams etc. and prepared my notes and during last 2 months before exams, i prepared all last 10 years questions and revised them 2-3 times...I started preparing for gynecology oncology from 2019 onwards...before starting my gynae onco preparation i first read anatomy from various books like Te Linde, william anatomy &nbsp;images (will help u a lot in ruling out options in anatomy mcqs), BDC, Novak, figo anatomy paper etc...Then I started preparing gynae onco in retrograde manner, like I started with devita review and william study guide gynae onco mcqs, then I read topics related to each and every option from devita, bereck, novak, williams and guidelines and prepared my notes in same manner...I really found this retrograde study of gynae onco very useful as onco is very vast and there are so many things to remember....</p>
              <p>For reproductive medicine part, I was totally blank, then I joined repro classes Dr Mona, I read speroff, gardner snd Dr Mona notes, for reproductive medicine part...also for general obg part I did william study guide and Dr Mona notes...During last 2 months, I did only retrograde study and did all reliable mcqs available from any source, this really helped to remember all points...last 5 days I did mcqs which I marked for revision and small points from my notes...I attempted 93 questions, and I think how many questions u attempt, depends upon paper...u can do decide before exam that I vl attempt this number of questions...My tip is- don&#39;t give up till last minute b4 exams, it&#39;s always like u feel many times, nahi hoga mera to, par agar lage rahoge to zarur hoga...n 1 more thing, even if u don&#39;t know abcd of question, just read options carefully before leaving that question, sometimes it&#39;s like u know options and don&#39;t know questions and u can correctly mark that question by ruling out options...</p>
