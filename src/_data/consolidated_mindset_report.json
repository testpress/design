      "explanation": "Moment of Inertia for a solid sphere is I = (2/5)MR². Substituting M=2, R=0.5 (or 1/2): I = (2/5) * 2 * (1/2)² = (4/5) * (1/4) = 1/5 = 0.2 kg m²."

      "explanation": "Reaction: 2C₄H₁₀ + 13O₂ → 8CO₂ + 10H₂O. The stoichiometry shows 2 moles of Butane require 13 moles of Oxygen. Common error is forgetting to balance the oxygen for both CO2 and H2O."
