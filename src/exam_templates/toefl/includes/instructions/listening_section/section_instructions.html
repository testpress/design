  <p>
    In this section, you will be able to demonstrate your ability to understand conversations and lectures in English. 
    The section is divided into two separately timed parts. You will hear each conversation or lecture only one time.
  </p>
  <p>A clock will indicate how much time remains. The clock will count down only while you are answering questions, not while you are listening.</p>
  <p>
    In some questions, you will see this icon: <img src="/img/toefl/headphone_icon.svg" class="mx-2 inline-block h-10 w-auto my-0" />
    This means that you will hear, but not see, part of the question.
  </p>
  <p>You must answer each question. After you answer, select <b>Next</b>. In the actual test you cannot return to previous questions.</p>
  <p>In <b>Timed Mode</b> in this practice test, select <b>OK</b> to confirm your answer and go on to the next question. In <b>Timed Mode</b>, you cannot return to previous questions.</p>
  <p>
    In <b>Untimed Mode</b> you may return to previous questions, and by selecting <b>Replay Talk</b> you may listen to each conversation and lecture again.
    <b>Replay Talk</b> is not available in the actual test. Note that returning to questions, conversations and lectures could result in a section score higher than the score you would receive if encountering them for the first time.
  </p>
  <p>Select <b>Continue</b> at any time to dismiss these directions.</p>
