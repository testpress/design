      "question": "Explain the impact of globalization on rural economies in India.",
      "user_answer": "Globalization has significantly influenced rural economies in India in both positive and negative ways. It has improved access to markets, technology, and information, allowing rural farmers to diversify crops and adopt modern agricultural techniques. Infrastructure development like roads, internet, and communication tools has enhanced rural connectivity.\nHowever, globalization has also created new challenges. Many small farmers find it difficult to compete with large agribusinesses and imported goods, leading to income insecurity. Traditional rural industries such as handloom weaving have suffered due to competition from mechanized and mass-produced products.\nThe migration of labor to urban areas in search of better opportunities has also resulted in a declining rural workforce. While globalization has opened doors for growth, rural areas need policy support, education, and skill-building to fully benefit. Sustainable models must be promoted to protect local livelihoods. Overall, the impact of globalization on rural India is mixed — with gains in access but risks to traditional stability.",
