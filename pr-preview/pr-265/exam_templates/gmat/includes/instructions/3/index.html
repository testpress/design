<h2 class="text-center mb-4 text-lg font-bold p-0 m-0">School Selection</h2>
<p>
  On the day of your test you will be able to select up to five (5) graduate management programs to receive your GMAT scores. If you wish to send your scores to more programs, or if you wish to send your scores to programs after you leave the test center, you may do so by visiting www.mba.com or by calling GMAT Customer Service. Please note that there is no additional fee for selecting programs now; however a fee will be charged for selecting programs later via the Web site, by phone, or by
  fax/mail. Also note that you cannot change or cancel your program selection later. Unless you cancel your test scores or your scores are cancelled automatically (because you did not indicate within two (2) minutes whether you wanted to cancel or report your scores), your score report will be sent to the programs you select here.
