<h2 class="text-center mb-4 text-lg font-bold p-0 m-0">Differences between GMAT Official Practice Exams and the GMAT Exam</h2>

<p>The tutorial, section instructions, exit screens and Report or Cancel Scores screens are not timed in the GMAT Official Practice Exams but WILL BE timed during the GMAT exam. You may want to send extra time on these screens in the Official Practice Exams to familiarize yourself with them before you take the actual test.</p>
<p>The optional break screens are not timed in the GMAT Official Practice Exams but will be timed when you sit for the exam. For the length of the optional breaks, refer to www.mba.com. Keep in mind that, if you exceed the time allowed for one of the optional breaks during the GMAT exam, the extra time will be deducted from the time available to complete the next section of exam material (the Quantitative, Verbal, or Integrated Reasoning section).</p>
<p>In the GMAT Official Practice Exams, you are permitted to move back and forth between the screens in the preliminary sections of the practice exams (the Welcome screen, the Nondisclosure Agreement, the school selection screen, and the tutorial). In the GMAT exam, you will not be able to return to a previous section once you have completed it.</p>
