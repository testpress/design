<p>In the GMATâ„¢ Official Practice Exams, you will have two (2) optional scheduled breaks during the exam. On the day of the exam, you will be given the opportunity to take a break at these times. A prompt will be displayed on your computer screen during these scheduled break times; if you choose to take a break, notify the Test Administrator by raising your hand.</p>
<ul class="list-disc text-black list-outside p-0 not-prose">
  <li class="ml-10 mt-0 text-black">You are not allowed to leave the test center premises during your break. Policies may vary depending on the test center location; it is your responsibility to ask the Administrator where you are permitted to go.</li>
  <li class="ml-10 mt-0 text-black">Each break will be up to 8 minutes. If you exceed the allotted time, the extra time will be deducted from the next exam section. Official time will be kept by the computer.</li>
</ul>
