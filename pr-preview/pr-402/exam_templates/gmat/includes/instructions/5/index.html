<p>When you take the GMATâ„¢ exam, you will have a specific amount of time to complete the tutorial. In the GMAT Official Practice Exams, this tutorial is not timed, so you may want to spend extra time reviewing the tutorial screens. (At any point in the exam, you will be able to see how much time you have remaining in the upper right corner of the screen.)</p>
<p>
  Just below the time remaining, you will see <span class="px-2 py-0.5 bg-[#3C3737] text-white pr-1.5"><span class="font-gmat-icon leading-7 align-middle mr-1">v</span>1 of 10</span>. This indicates that you are viewing the first of 10 questions or screens.

  You can minimize the time remaining and the question number reminders by clicking on them. When you have five (5) minutes remaining, the time remaining will automatically reappear. To restore them, click on the <span class="px-2 py-0.5 bg-[#3C3737] text-[#FFFF00] pr-1.5"><span class="font-gmat-icon leading-7 align-middle mr-1">A</span></span> and <span class="px-2 py-0.5 bg-[#3C3737] text-white pr-1.5"><span class="font-gmat-icon leading-7 align-middle mr-1">v</span></span> icons.
