<h2 class="text-center mb-4 text-lg font-bold p-0 m-0">GMAT Exam Questions</h2>

<p>You must select an answer to each question before moving on to the next question - no skipping. You cannot return to a previous question or change your answer once you have moved on to the next question.</p>
<p>Note that in some sections of the GMAT exam, certain parts of a question may remain the same through multiple questions (Example: visual graphics or text passages).</p>
<p>If you do not finish all the questions in the allotted time for a section, you will receive a score, but it will reflect a penalty for not finishing the test.</p>
<p>Test Center Only: Use the erasable noteboards provided to you by the Test Administrator to work out your answers. All erasable noteboards must be returned to the Test Administrator at the end of the test session.</p>
