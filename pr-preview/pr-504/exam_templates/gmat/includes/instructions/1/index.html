<p >The GMAT Official Practice Exams are a simulation of the real GMAT exam. While they do use the same scoring algorithm as the actual GMAT exam there are some differences between the practice exams and the real exam which are detailed on the following screens.</p>
<p>Before you take the real GMAT exam, we highly recommend that you visit www.mba.com/tutorial to view the online tutorial, which provides important information and reminders about the GMAT exam.</p>
